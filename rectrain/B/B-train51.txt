375g pack ready-rolled puff pastry
150g log goat's cheese
rosemary sprigs

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut out 8 x 8cm circles from the ready-rolled puff pastry. Arrange on a baking sheet and prick the middles a few times with a fork. Cook for 10 mins, then remove from oven.
Cut the goat’s cheese into 8 slices. Press 1 slice into each pastry round, then top with rosemary sprigs. Season, then cook for 10-15 mins more, until the cheese is melted and the pastry is puffed up and crisp.
