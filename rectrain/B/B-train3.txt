4 whole dabs, dark skin scored
1 tbsp olive oil
50g butter
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
juice 1/2 lemon
small bunch parsley, finely chopped
250g bag spinach

Heat the grill to high. Cut the frills away from the sides of the dabs using scissors. Lay the fish on a baking tray, dark skin up, drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with some sea salt. Place under a hot grill for 5 mins, until cooked through and the flesh comes away from the bone when prodded.
Meanwhile, heat the butter in a frying pan until it starts to turn brown, then add the garlic and cook until it just starts to change colour. Remove the pan from the heat, add the lemon juice and parsley, stir together and set aside.
Wilt the spinach in a hot pan with a splash of water, then divide between 2 plates. Place 2 dabs on top of the spinach on each plate, drizzle with the butter sauce and serve.
