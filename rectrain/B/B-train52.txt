8 large portobello mushrooms
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
150g mild goat's cheese
4 slices ham, halved
2 tbsp olive oil
50g pine nuts, lightly toasted
small handful parsley, roughly chopped
toasted ciabatta and salad, to serve

Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Wipe the mushrooms with kitchen paper and place on a baking tray, gills facing up. Season, then scatter with the garlic, dot with the goat’s cheese and top each with a piece of ham.
Drizzle over olive oil, cover with foil, then cook in the oven for 10 mins. After 5 mins, remove the foil and return to the oven.
When the mushrooms are tender and the cheese melted and bubbling, scatter over the pine nuts and parsley. Serve with toasted ciabatta and a dressed winter leaf salad.
