2 kg Jersey Royal new potatoes, skins scrubbed
50 g salted butter
250 g smoked trout fillets or the grated zest of 1 lemon & juice of 1/2 lemon cider vinegar
a small bunch of chives, finely chopped

Cook the Jersey Royals in a saucepan of salted boiling water for about 15 minutes, or until lovely and soft when pricked with a fork. Drain in a colander and let them steam dry. 
Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and gently crush a few with a fork to add texture. Add the butter and season well. Flake in half of the smoked trout, add the cider vinegar (or lemon zest and juice) and toss through. Serve at room temperature, with the remaining trout flaked over and chives snipped on top. 
This salad is delicious served on its own or with some soft round lettuce.
