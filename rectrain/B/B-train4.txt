3 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
1 red chilli, finely chopped
2 tbsp tomato purée
1kg tomatoes, roughly chopped
200ml white wine
350ml fish stock
3 strips orange zest
1kg skinless halibut fillets, cut into large chunks
500g clams
400g large raw prawns
handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped
For the garlic toasts
1 large ciabatta loaf, cut into 1cm slices
5 tbsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves, halved

To make the garlic toasts, drizzle the bread with oil, then griddle or grill until golden all over. While the toasts are still hot, rub them with garlic and set aside.
Heat the oil in a wide, deep frying pan. Add the onion and cook over a gentle heat for 5 mins until softened. Stir through the garlic and chilli and cook a couple of mins more. Add the tomato purée and tomatoes. Turn up the heat and cook for 10-15 mins, stirring until the tomatoes are pulpy. Pour over the wine and cook for 10 mins more until most of it has boiled away.
Add the fish stock and orange zest and heat until gently simmering. Nestle the halibut chunks into the liquid and cook for 5 mins. Add the clams and prawns and cook for 5 mins more until the fish is cooked through and the clams have opened (discard any that haven’t). Sprinkle the parsley over the stew and serve with the garlic toasts.
