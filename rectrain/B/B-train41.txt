3 tbsp tamari or dark soy sauce
2 tbsp seasoned rice vinegar
1 tbsp mirin or 2 tsp caster sugar
200g firm tofu, drained, patted dry and cut into 8 cubes
cornflour, for coating
sunflower oil, for frying
1 bunch asparagus, base of stalks snapped off, cut diagonally into about 4 pieces
50g fresh or frozen edamame beans
50g frozen peas
small piece ginger, grated
400g pack straight-to-wok udon noodles
coriander leaves, to garnish
chilli oil, to serve

Combine the tamari or soy sauce, vinegar and mirin or sugar in a shallow bowl and stir until dissolved. Place the tofu in the marinade and turn to coat. Leave to absorb the flavours for about 30 mins or more. (If marinating for several hours, keep in the fridge.)
When ready to cook, turn the oven on to warm. Scatter the cornflour over a plate. Remove the tofu from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and roll in the cornflour to coat all sides. Heat a wide frying pan over a medium-high and add enough sunflower oil to cover the base of the pan. Fry the tofu, using tongs to turn, until dark golden and crisp all over. Drain on kitchen paper, then keep warm in the oven.
Place 1 litre of water in a medium saucepan with the reserved marinade and bring to the boil. Add asparagus, edamame beans, peas, ginger and noodles and return to the boil. Simmer until the vegetables are just tender, about 3-4 mins. Divide between 4 bowls and place 2 tofu cubes in each. Top with coriander leaves and serve drizzled with a little of the chilli oil.
