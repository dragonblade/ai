400g pack cooked seafood mix
300g pack cooked thin rice noodles
300g pack cooked beansprouts
3 carrots, thinly sliced
1 bunch spring onions, sliced lengthways
bunch mint and coriander, leaves chopped
For the dressing
5 tbsp rice wine vinegar
1 tsp caster sugar
1 red chilli, chopped
1 stick lemongrass, sliced
1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce

To make the salad put all of the vegetables and seafood in a large bowl, reserving a few of the herbs for the top. Mix everything together, so that the seafood and noodles are combined.
Make the dressing by mixing all of the ingredients, toss this through the salad, then divide between 5 deep bowls or pile on to a large platter and let everyone help themselves. Scatter the reserved herbs over the top to serve.
