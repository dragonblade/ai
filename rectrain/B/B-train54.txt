450g haggis

Preheat the oven to fan 180C/conventional 200C/gas 6. Remove the outer packaging from the haggis then prick all over with a fork, wrap in foil like a baked potato and bake in the oven for 1 hour.
To serve, split open the haggis with a sharp knife and spoon the contents over neeps and tatties or serve separately.
