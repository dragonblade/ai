250g pack firm tofu, drained (we used Cauldron)
2 tbsp reduced-salt soy sauce, plus extra to serve (optional)
300g green veg (we used mange tout and halved bok choi)
1 garlic clove, sliced
small knob of ginger, peeled and shredded
300g pack straight-to-wok egg noodles (or use 2 sheets medium dried egg noodles and follow pack instructions)
1 tbsp sesame seed
1 tbsp sesame oil, plus extra to serve (optional)

Cut the tofu into 12 pieces and mix with 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 tsp of sesame oil. Heat the remaining oil in a wok, then stir-fry the vegetables, garlic and ginger for 2 mins until the vegetables are starting to wilt. Drizzle with 2 tbsp water, then stir-fry for another min.
Add the noodles, sesame seeds and soy sauce from the marinated tofu, then stir-fry for 2 mins. Now add the tofu, splash over the remaining soy sauce, then cover with a lid or baking sheet. Leave for 1 min so that the tofu heats through, then gently mix into the rest of the stir-fry.
Lift the noodles and tofu into bowls and splash over a little more soy sauce and sesame oil to serve, if you like.
