300g rindless soft goat's cheese
a splash extra-virgin olive oil
crushed pink peppercorns, white and black toasted sesame seeds, snipped fresh chives or cayenne pepper

Place the rindless soft goat’s cheese in a bowl and roughly mash with a splash extra-virgin olive oil and season to taste. Take small spoonfuls and roll into bite-sized balls. Chill, covered on a baking sheet until ready to use. Roll in coverings of your choice; crushed pink peppercorns, white and black toasted sesame seeds, snipped fresh chives or cayenne pepper all work well. Keep in the fridge until ready to serve, with cocktail sticks.
Make them ahead; the rolled and coated balls will keep, covered in the fridge, for up to a day.
