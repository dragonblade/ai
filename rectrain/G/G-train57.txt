450g caster sugar
8 pomegranates

Tip the sugar into a bowl and pour over 600ml of boiling water from a kettle. Stir to dissolve, then set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, juice the pomegranates. Squeeze and press the skin of seven of the pomegranates vigorously to crush the seeds inside. Hold the squashed fruit over a bowl, slit the skin with a knife and the juice will pour out. Mix the juice with the syrup and churn in an ice-cream machine until set, then scoop into a plastic container and freeze. Serve the sorbet in scoops, scattered with a few seeds from the remaining fruit.
