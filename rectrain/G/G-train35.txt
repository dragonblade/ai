3 large potatoes
3 carrots
1/2 swede
25g butter
splash of milk or cream
good grating of nutmeg

Cut the veg into similar-sized chunks. Tip into a pan of cold salted water, bring to a boil, cover, then cook for 15-20 mins until all the vegetables are tender.
Drain, leave to steam-dry for a few mins, then tip back into the pan and mash with the butter, milk or cream, nutmeg and some seasoning. Keep warm until ready to serve.
