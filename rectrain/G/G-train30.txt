100g self-raising flour
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
50g butter
75g dark muscovado sugar
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 medium egg, beaten
3 tbsp semi-skimmed milk
40g pecans nuts, chopped
50g raisins
For the topping
25g butter
3 tbsp double cream
2 tbsp maple syrup

First make the topping. Put the butter, double cream and maple syrup together in a small pan and stir over a low heat until well mixed. Bring to the boil, simmer for 1 min, then pour into the base of a buttered 900ml pudding basin.
Sift the flour into a bowl with the cinnamon and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat the butter with the sugar and maple syrup until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg a little at a time. Fold the dry ingredients into the creamed butter and egg mixture, adding the milk to give a soft dropping consistency. Stir in nuts and raisins.
Spoon the mixture into the basin, then cover with greased greaseproof paper and foil, making a pleat in the centre of both. Tie securely with string.
Steam the pudding for 11 hrs, checking regularly to make sure that the pan doesn’t boil dry. Turn out and serve with extra warmed maple syrup and a generous helping of double cream.
