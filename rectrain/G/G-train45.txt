little butter or oil, for the tin
140g spaghetti
6 tsp tomato pasta sauce
6 medium eggs
6 basil leaves

Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter 6 holes of a muffin tin with butter or oil. Cook the spaghetti following the pack instructions, then cool under cold running water and drain. Divide most of the spaghetti between the 6 holes, creating nest shapes. Top with tomato sauce, then crack an egg on top of each.
Wrap the remaining spaghetti around the egg yolks and gently tap the tin to allow the egg whites to seep through the spaghetti. Bake for 20 mins until the egg whites are set and the yolk a little runny. Carefully remove from the tin with a blunt knife and serve, topped with basil leaves.
