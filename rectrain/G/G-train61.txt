firm cheese
your childrens' favourite fruit eg grapes, apples, pears

We sometimes forget how good the simple things are. This is an easy snack to rustle up and great for getting the kids to eat fruit. Just chop up your kids’ favourite fruit and firm cheese and thread the pieces onto cocktail sticks or skewers. Tony's kids all like apples, pears and grapes and love cheddar, but feel free to try your own combinations.
