568ml pot single cream
140g caster sugar
4 egg yolks
1 tsp vanilla extract
200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa), plus extra to decorate
For the cherry sauce
1/2 400g can cherries
2 tbsp kirsch or brandy
To serve
148ml double cream
2 tsp icing sugar
2 brownie squares
For the brownies
200g butter
175g dark brown sugar
140g granulated sugar
4 eggs
50g ground almonds
50g plain flour
200g dark chocolate

For the ice cream, pour the cream into a pan and bring to the boil. Beat together the sugar, egg yolks and vanilla. Pour over 2 tbsp of the cream and whisk into the egg mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the pan with the cream, lower the heat, then cook for a few mins, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, until the custard coats the back of the spoon.
Melt the chocolate in the microwave on High for 1 min, then stir into the bowl of custard. When the custard has cooled, churn in an ice-cream maker according to manufacturers’ instructions.
To make the sauce, drain the cherries, reserving the liquid, then set aside. Place the liquid in a pan with the kirsch or brandy and simmer for 5 mins, or until syrupy. Return the cherries to the pan to heat through.
To assemble the sundaes, whip the cream with the icing sugar until soft peaks form. Cut the brownies into bite-size pieces, then place a handful at the bottom of 4 glasses. Scoop the ice cream on top, then drizzle with the cherries and sauce. Dollop with whipped cream and scatter with grated chocolate.
FOR THE BROWNIES: Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then grease and line a 20cm square brownie tin. Heat the butter and dark chocolate in a pan until melted. Stir through dark brown sugar and granulated sugar. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then mix through the eggs. Stir in the almonds and flour. Pour into the tin, then bake for 30-35 mins until just cooked through. (Makes 16)
