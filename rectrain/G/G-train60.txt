1l carton of mango & passionfruit smoothie
4 passion fruits, halved
1 mango, peeled, stoned and sliced

Pour the smoothie into a container such as a loaf tin and freeze overnight, or until solid. Remove and allow to soften slightly for 10-15 mins. Scrape out the seeds from the passion fruit and set aside.
Scoop the frozen smoothie into rough balls using an ice-cream scoop or spoon, then put inside each halved passion fruit. Serve with the sliced mango and passion fruit seeds.
