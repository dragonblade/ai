350g penne pasta
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
8 rashers smoked back bacon, chopped
200ml hot vegetable stock
300g frozen peas
150g pack gorgonzola, cubed
250g spinach

Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan, then add the onion and cook for 3 mins until starting to soften. Add the bacon, cook for a further 5 mins, then pour in the hot stock and bring to the boil. Simmer for a few mins until the liquid has reduced slightly.
Stir in the peas, followed by the Gorgonzola, until the cheese has melted and the peas are defrosted. Quickly stir through the spinach to wilt. Drain the pasta and mix with the sauce, then serve.
