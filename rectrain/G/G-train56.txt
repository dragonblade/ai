1kg ice cubes (half a bag from a supermarket)
4 luxury fruit lollies (or for however many people you are serving)

For a really clever, time-saving cheat, just buy the best lollies you can, then it’s all in the presentation - thick clear glass and ice looks great together
Put the ice cubes in a large plastic bag, cover with a tea towel, and bash with a hammer until roughly crushed. Return to the freezer. Once ready to serve, pile the crushed ice into a deep, narrow glass bowl or ice bucket and push in the lollies, stick upwards.
