200g Madeira cake, cut into small cubes
50g almonds, roughly chopped
2 tbsp brandy
390g jar cherry compote (or apricot or rhubarb)
300g tub vanilla-flavoured custard
2x 40g bars nut brittle

Tip the Madeira cake and nuts into a medium bowl. Drizzle over the brandy and stir well. Divide the mixture between 6 large tumblers, then top with compote and custard.
Break the bars of nut brittle into a food processor and blitz until crushed quite finely. (You can prepare to this stage up to two hours before serving.)
When ready to serve, sprinkle a thick layer of crushed brittle on top of each tumbler.
