800g fresh prepared squid
zest 3 limes (reserve the juice for the salad, and wedges, to serve)
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3 garlic cloves, smashed flat
1.5 tsp mixed peppercorns, crushed
For the salad
1 large red onion, finely sliced
1 large mango, cut into small chunks
1 large red chilli, finely shredded (deseeded if you don't like it too hot)
400g can black beans, well rinsed then patted dry
3 ripe avocados
small pack coriander, leaves only, torn
extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling

Heat the barbecue. Meanwhile, marinate the squid for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs. First, slash the squid tubes all over at 5mm-1cm intervals on each side, cutting through most of the flesh but leaving the sides intact. If there are any particularly large tubes, cut them in half width-ways. Put into a non-metallic bowl with the other squid ingredients and leave to marinate.
For the salad, toss the onion, mango and chilli with the lime juice (from the limes used for the squid) and a pinch of salt and leave for at least 10 mins, or until the onion turns pink. Add the beans to one side of the bowl.
Halve, stone and scoop the avocado into the salad bowl, then add plenty of seasoning and season the squid with sea salt.
When the barbecue is ready, barbecue the squid tubes and tentacles for no more than 11/2 mins in total – the flesh should just change from greyish to opaque and shrink up into a spiral shape where you’ve made your cuts. Toss the salad ingredients together very roughly, pile onto a platter and top with the hot squid and coriander. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and serve with lime wedges on the side.
