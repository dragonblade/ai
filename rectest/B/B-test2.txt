400g fusilli
500g bag spinach
2 garlic cloves
2 tbsp olive oil
200g pack reduced-fat feta-style cheese
50g pine nuts
good pinch nutmeg
handful black olives, roughly chopped

Boil the pasta according to pack instructions. Meanwhile, boil a kettle of water, then slowly pour over the spinach in a colander until it wilts. Shake off the excess water, then put the spinach into a food processor.
Add the garlic, oil, half of the cheese and most of the pine nuts to the processor with the spinach, then pulse to a pesto-like sauce. Season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper. Stir through the hot, drained pasta and serve topped with the olives and the remaining crumbled cheese and pine nuts.
